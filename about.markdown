# Hello!

I'm a developer for the Mindbody App Android team at Mindbody, Inc. in gorgeous San Luis Obispo. I work very heavily in Kotlin, Android and Java technologies daily, and not-so-heavily in Ruby, C#, Rails and server administration on the side.

I hope you find my posts useful or entertaining (hopefully in the way they were meant :).
